 * The layout configuration is used to define the overall layout of the storefront.
 * The configuration includes the following aspects:
 * - breakpoint layout (AKA screen layout)
 * - Page sections slot configuration (i.e. header vs footer)
 * - page template slot configuration (i.e. landing page template vs PDP page template)
 * - deferred loading configuration
 *
 * The page slot configurations is directly related to the data in the backend. If you use the
 * Spartacus sample-data, you will have an aligned setup. However, if you introduce custom page
 * templates and/or slots, you most likely need to further adjust or replace this configuration.
